---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code below contain various parts of our pipeline. In general, this project
involved writing scripts to conduct various parts, but the SQL code was
executed on the Amazon Athena service. Furthermore, several intermediate files
were generated, which we do not include here. We only include the final output
in the "data" folder.

The code snippets are below:

(1) The SQL commands we ran on the Amazon AWS Athena service are contained
in the "commands_Athena.txt" file, including an explanation of what they do.

(2) "get_varying_positions.py" contains legacy code we at first tried when 
trying to get the point mutation differences between two individuals. However,
this was too slow on Python and we switched to Athena. To use, update the
AFFECTED_FILES and UNAFFECTED_FILES global variables to include filenames
in the data/ directory of Athena CSV files for unaffected and affected males,
then run "python get_varying_positions.py"

(3) "clean_file.sh" is a short script we created to clean the dataset 
downloaded from Athena. This script is used in "intersect.sh"

(4) The "agg_anno_genos.sh" script finds variants that are overexpressed in our 
n=9 group based on the population allele frequency. Because our n is small, we 
look at observed - expected and then filter for (obs-exp) > X where X is a cutoff.
A low x will give more variants, while a high x will filter more. This filtering can 
be done in the last awk command, or it can be done in the SQL table uploaded into the 
iHart database. The code is commented as is, as it runs on big data.

(5) The "intersect.sh" script joins the lists of gene annotations from all pairs.
It requires intermediate files from above.

(6) "chromosome_visualizer.py" created a visualization of the chromosome location
of each of the variants that occur frequently in the unaffected males but not in
the affected males.

(7) "chromosome_representation.png" contains a plot created from (6), not
included in our final presentation, and 
"chromosome_representation_normalized.png" contains a version of this plot in
a histogram normalized by chromosome size.

A description of the data is below:

affected_family.txt - a list of affected individual phenotype data we extracted
from Athena

affected_males_affected_parents.csv - a list of phenotype data for the entire
family set we conducted our analysis on

all_homoz_goi.txt - all homozygous genes of interest

all_homoz_goi_uniq.txt - all unique homozygous genes of interest

chromosome_frequencies_normalized.csv - frequency of point mutations by chromosome size

final_gene_list.txt - 

gene_list_103.bed - BED list of genes obtained from analysis of unaffected vs. affected,
only looking at coding exons

gene_list_103 - list of genes obtained from analysis of unaffected vs. affected, only
looking at coding exons

gene_list_whole_genome.bed - BED list of genes obtained from analysis of unaffected vs. 
affected, looking at the whole genome

gene_list_whole_genome - list of genes obtained from analysis of unaffected vs. 
affected, looking at the whole genome

genes_of_interest.txt - genes to perform enrichment analysis on

genes_of_interest_analysis_2.csv - genes to perform enrichment analysis on, including
additional metadata

goi_uniq.txt - a unique list of genes of interest for the "agg_anno_genos.sh" script

unaffected_family.txt - phenotype info for unaffected family members

unaffected_males_affected_parents.csv - phenotype info for affected parents
